Tough question. Should Software Architects write code like developers do? Should they be part of the development team? The question has been around for  years and still there are strong opinions in all directions.

Some years ago, this article from Martin Fowler [Who needs an Architect](http://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/whoNeedsArchitect.pdf) made a clear distinction between two types of Architect. The first one is confined in their ivory tower throwing tons of UML pages down the developers which little or no sense of whats feasible or not. That what Fowler called *Architectus Reloadus*, as analogy to the Matrix Architect from the film *Matrix Reloaded*.

The second and opposite was a coordinator between all project stakeholder, mainly developers, project manager and product owner. This kind of Architect makes sure the design has been understood by  all parties and proved to be realistic.  Try to reach consensus among the stakeholders about how the final solution should be and supports the development during the project.

I believe the latter describes much better what a Software Architect is suppose to do. Sure there are legions of  *Architectus Reloadus* in many companies, but their contribution to customer value are close to zero.

Clarified the role of the Software Architect , let’s go back to the question in the title of this post: should she write code as anybody else in the development team? In my opinion, it depends.

In projects of small complexity or those that have reached a certain level of maturity, the architect can be a senior member of the development team, skilled enough to conceive the new functionality in her head and point the team into the right direction. In that case, this *de facto* architect will code as anyone else. This is the approach followed by many companies were there isn’t anyone with the title Software Architect in the business card but there are people which cares about the big picture.   

Having said that, beyond certain level of complexity, the role of Software Architect becomes a full time job. Coordinate a mid-size development team, keeping an eye on the development and integration stream, and feeding the project management and other stakeholders with regular updates leave not too much time to other activities. In such projects, having the Architect coding a significant amount of the functionality lead to have only a part-time architect, which definitely slows down the project. At the end, the Architect is almost always in the critical path of the project. Slowing her down means slowing the whole project down.

Additionally, a good programmer needs quietness and isolate herself to focus in such a demanding activity like coding. This is not always possible as the architect is usually the most interrupted person of the team.  Switching contexts during programming leads to sloppy code. 

What I believe is a Software Architect must *be able to* code her own designs. But it does not mean she has to. A Software Architect must be always ready to open her Laptop and speak with the developer in their own language (in the broad sense of the word *language*). That makes them respected and accepted in the team as an equal. Developers, at the end, like to talk only with other developers.
