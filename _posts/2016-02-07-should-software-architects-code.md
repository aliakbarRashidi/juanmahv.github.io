Tough question. Should Software Architects write code like developers do? Should they be part of the development team? The question has been around for  years and still there are strong opinions going in all directions.

Some years ago, this article from Martin Fowler [Who needs an Architect](http://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/whoNeedsArchitect.pdf) made a clear distinction between two types of Architect these confined in their ivory towers throwing tons of UML pages down the developers which little or no sense of whats feasible or not. That what Fowler called *Architectus Reloadus*, as an analogy to the Matrix Architect from the film *Matrix Reloaded*.

The opposite was the Architect role as coordinator between all project stakeholder, mainly developers, project manager and product owner. This kind of Architect makes sure the design has been understood by  all parties and proved to be realistic.  Try to reach consensus among the stakeholders about how the final solution will be and coach the development during the project.

I believe the second type describes much better what a Software Architect is suppose to do. There may be *Architectus Reloadus* out in the companies, but their contribution to customer value are close to zero.

Clarified the role of the Software Architect , let’s go back to the question in the title of this post: should she write code as a developer more? In my opinion, it depends.

Project of small complexity or those that have reached a certain level of maturity, the architect can be a senior member of the development team, skilled enough to conceive the new functionality in her head and point the team into the right direction. In that case, the *de facto* architect will code as anyone else. This is the approach followed by many companies were there isn’t anyone with the title Software Architect in the business card.   

But beyond certain level of complexity, the role of Software Architect becomes a full time job. Coordinate a mid-size development team, keeping an eye on the development and integration stream, and feeding the project management and other stakeholders with updates leave not too much time to other activities. In such projects, having the Architect coding a significant amount of the functionality lead to have only a part-time architect, which definitely slows down the project. At the end, the Architect is almost always in the critical path of the project. Slowing her down means slowing the whole project down.

What I believe is a Software Architect must *be able to* code her own design. But it does not mean she has to. A Software Architect must be always ready to open her Laptop and speak with the developer in their own language (in the broad sense of the word *language*). That’s the only way Architects can be respected and accepted in the team, instead of been considered merely as producer of document  which do not have too much to do with the code at the end.
