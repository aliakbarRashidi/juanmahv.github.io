Choosing the right tools is a key factor of success for any software project. This gold rule is out 
of discussion for many managers, at least the most successful ones, who do not hesitate to 
allocate time and resources for early evaluations of any new technology. Unfortunately, 
decisions about which programming language to pick seems not to deserve the same attention 
as many other technical questions, even though choosing the wrong language is a costly 
mistake. An inadequate programing language leads to opportunity cost that the company has 
to suffer. Opportunity costs are not easily measurable, but they exist.

Especially in the embedded world, a holy war between C and C++ programming languages has 
been running since decades. When C++ emerged as general purpose object oriented language 
in the early-nineties, it quickly surpassed his old brother C in many software sectors as the 
most widely used programming language. This trend however, runs in a slow lane if we talk 
about embedded software development, where C language is still king. Most IT Companies 
running embedded projects seems to be more than reluctant to move on and embrace the 
benefits of C++ and the object oriented approach as software design paradigm. The reasons 
for such mindset vary, but they all have something in common: they don't consider the 
advantages of C++ in the long term, beyond the scope of the project. They fail to see that C++ 
can lead to a higher operative efficiency and can even turn into a competitive advantage for the 
company in terms of reducing development costs.

If I should highlight the advantage of C++ against C with only one word, it will be Reusability. In 
computer science, is the possibility of use the same code in different contexts to solve 
different problems. Of course C, as any other modular languages, offers certain level of 
reusability in form of functions and procedures. But C++ boosts this concept by introducing 
one of the most typical object oriented features: inheritance. C++ lets functions -now called 
methods- and data be grouped together and be considered as one unit. By inheriting from a 
class its entire interface -except the part defined private- is placed at the disposal of the heirs. 
And the best is that it only cost one line of code; the hard work is made by the compiler. But 
reusing is not just a matter of reducing coding time, but -and even more important- debugging 
sessions. Bugs are the old enemy of every software project. They are like bacteria. You cannot 
see them, but they are there, and cannot be avoided. As E. W. Dijkstra magisterially pointed 
out, we can only be sure about the existence of bugs, not about their absence. Therefore, all 
countermeasures taken in earlier phases of a project to minimize bug fixing in the later, will pay 
off. By inheriting from well tested classes we reduce the development risks and the potential 
costs of debugging.

Companies are run by people in the end. An IT company is intensive in human capital and one 
of the main drivers of success for technology companies is to attract, generate and retain 
human talent. In order to get good people a company has to look over its shoulder form time 
to time and have a look to the market. In IT business the technology runs fast and what 
yesterday was a trending technology today may not be considered by the programmer 
community as attractive as I used to be. Companies which stick to out-of-fashioned 
technologies can face hard times to get skilled programmers, and if they do, it will be certainly 
at a higher cost. Scarcity of resources increases their price, is basic economics. 

The same argumentation applies when it comes to retain talent. In the same way that people 
expect their financial assets to increase their value over the time - or at least, not to lose it-, the 
technical assets deserve a similar dedication. As the market evolves, new professional profiles 
go on demand and some others lose their charm. Especially in periods of economic growth 
and low unemployment ratios, when the professional mobility increases, those companies 
based on unattractive technologies suffer from high personnel rotations. Every manager knows 
that high rotations can slow down a project dramatically, as the learning curve of the team 
never achieves the break-even point. In other words, the development costs associated to 
your people's skills don't decrease as much as they will if the team were stable. As a matter of 
fact, the market today is abundant in skilled object oriented C++ programmers. Many of them 
have more than one decade of experience in the industry. For sure most of them are also 
proficient at C and can be hired, but if they want to remain tied to C for a long time, is another 
question.

Innovation is probably the best lifeboat for a company to sail the sea of unknowing. IT 
companies rightly consider innovation as one key of success; a mean to keep a competitive 
advantage in the long run. Innovation champions have all something in common: they 
experiment with new technologies and are not afraid of making mistakes. Many of them even 
mention innovation in their mission statement explicitly and try to make it part of their culture. 
But even though the innovation mantra is heavily invoked by most part of the industry, in many 
cases this enthusiasm dissipates when it comes to daily work. The reluctance to introduce C++, 
not even as a pilot project, is a good example. The rationalization of this position is often 
bolstered up with conservative arguments, which contradict the whole idea of innovation. How can 
a company call itself innovator when is not able to question its own practices?

C++ is a mature technology. It has been around for more than thirty years and has proved to 
be an efficient programming language for the industry. There are no reasons why embedded 
software companies cannot profit from the same advantages as other business did in the past. 
Discussions about C vs. C++ in embedded systems are quite recurrent, but often take the form 
of quite technical debates where the management prefers to remain aside. Little or none 
attention has been paid to this topic focuses on how it can affect the business. Because in fact, 
all decisions a company takes has an impact on the P&L, sometimes in the form of revenues, 
sometimes as opportunity costs. For high competitive businesses, the lack of knowhow is like 
an open wound. And in this case the pain is even more because is self-inflicted. The C++ 
market in abundant at this time. If you do not have the right people, hire consultant, but move 
on, don't stay behind the trend. Tomorrow the gap will be certainly harder to fill.
